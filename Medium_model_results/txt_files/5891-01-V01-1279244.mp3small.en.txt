lived there with my family i was born for the summertime and we were out there with wagons and i was born out there in the hospital somewhere in eisen my i am a gypsy my family was gypsy we had traveled around in the summertime over in germany as we were children my whole family and my mother had this year in eisen next year in wodersbach every 14 15 months my alden had 14 15 children eight boys and seven girls and i was born in eisen and somewhere in the hospital there and tell me you were born in the summertime what was summertime like gypsy girl as a gypsy girl it was beautiful the best time in the morning you get up with the birds at night you sleep with the stars and the moon my parents my father was a hundlzmann as we called it in german in germany was hundlzmann he's a basket weaver he was a horse trader also and that's what he used to do in the summertime we leave there in april may sometimes all depends how the weather was we got back when the frost came and he made all his money in his living in the summer out there then when we got home of course he had horses he continued his horse trading business there we had a barn my alden house right across the street was the barn and there we had horses pigs for our own being for own bedar and it was wonderful life we had to chill as children but this was a life we loved this is a life we knew and of course we did go to school in the summer i need to remind say this that we did go to the schools in all different parts wherever we were what town city wherever if it was for three days it was for two days we went to school we had a book and they had to be signed by the principals in each particular town and it just had to all harmonize together we weren't missing any school because that's the only way my parents could take us out of school and that's how we were raised and then we had our steady schooling in the fall when we got home where was home home was beating clubs and there we are alden house a steady home my dad had bought us home before even was born there and i think they had four or five children when they bought that house and we just grew up in that house when i left germany i am in the united states that alden house was there my family's still in there today it's a little bigger house because my one of my nif so going back to the gypsy life it's a wonderful life i mean i can't say anything else about it was it's even alive it's hard to explain you really have to live that type of a life a little artistic my dad was in the weaving business making baskets fine stuff furniture and my mother had her children and we were taking care of each other but it was a good life we had lots of love that's one thing i have to say lots of children maybe not too much with the clothes in the situation but we had a lot ate all the time what did you eat food plenty of food all the german foods the cut off was a lot and the potatoes of soup and they get vegetables you know they can use it this solution as a good life and i'd have benefit from that short life that i had with my family my childhood tell me what a summertime day was like let's just pick a day in july who was a heartless heart and human he hasn't too good spring in the fall is not but they're not hot you're the humidity day is the worst thing well in the morning we got up and we had to go to school did you take care of animals or anything first no the boys had to do that no the boys had to do that but we as young girls when we were young girls we had that age had a choice of course what were your choice taking care of the little ones the next on the mirror the next above me not so much above me the one on the baby each had their chair raising children helping the race each other because there were so many of them and this is something we just did automatically we knew what we had to do and we've done it the boys should help with the animals oh yeah and then later on as i got older if we got older we were home in the fall and my father had the pigs in the in the horses of course and occasionally he'd have take some cows in and you just the children to care you know boys that bigger and they help with the business and the girls had to help we had to help washing and we also had to take turns with cooking and and donning you know there's plenty of wash to do and there was no automatics like well today was all we had a wash and a wash cushion they called it and there was strictly two three days on the site just for washing the white clothes was boiled sometimes in us and when the sun was out that was hung into the sun was brought back in again we're in the winter again and that everything was clean of course it was a much more work than that but it's much easier today so so you get up in the morning and go to school go to school and of course it wasn't easy sometimes you know it's been in because we were used to it it's just that when you come strange school again and school again we had to make friends you know sometimes was easy sometimes a little harder to make friends you know but then after school time we went had to go and we came home and went picked up like they do today we had to work sometimes we were a mile away from the school or two miles and we're just four or five of us just marched down to the school didn't think not enough we were in the school we marched back saying sometimes got in trouble stopped on the sport plot some we would ever played games or something was going on and we didn't go straight home my mother was mad she was worried she was mad because just waiting for certain things to be done so then got plenty a little i don't know how to say it but we had plenty of she had a little stick a little wooden stick that came out once in a while that's the way we were a little punishment did she ever use the stick on you she sure did what did you do that you know it was not so much the stick my mother was left-handed and when my mother got gone we're wanting to she'll call julia before she got to me betty susie lena sure wherever she calls all 14 of a bitch till she got that 15 one you know and that's the way it was with said mom i didn't do it but that left hand just went automatically everywhere and that's the way it was you know oh well i sorry i happen to sit there so there it was you know it was too many of them you know and and we knew that so but we loved them mama mama's one one but there too they were wonderful parents but whatever they'd done for what toward is toward his beautiful things the most of our love it never went away i think we love each other now more we got an old and someone passed away and it's just you can't buy that in the truck stores you can't get it anywhere it is something you have from home from as a child and that's the way it was can i do that how did you travel everything my wagons horses or we had bikes weird i remember my sister matilda who died in auschwitz she was had she was working doing some work for some was a big big great day and they had cows and animals and she had a job there and out in the fields to mean worn the grass and everything and those days they didn't have all this machinery stuff they had those senses you know i don't know what they call that in america cut the grass with you know was a little like said that we call it a sensor that's like a handstick on it and size it's like a sensor okay what they call it and that sensor went in her leg and she cut her angle on that so she had to be hospitalized and took it to mom work 33 kilometers from bean cove and we used to go visit her on the bikes 33 mile kilometers gone and 33 kilo there's no problem at all those days that's how we that's all we knew no no fancy buses and fancy this and that but this and it was we've done this you know you say today 33 mile kilometers born and dirty just 66 kilometer on a bike you know i mean it was a daily routine really and i don't know how i got to talk about but they're telling me about the wagons and the bikes so there was no that you know if the wagon my dad was sometimes my dad was hired for doing the field work like plowing their fields because we had the horses and the equipment so my dad did that kind of work also now and of course the bigger girls or the boys was around had to help drive the horses or he loaded up the wagons and you know 13 12 or no matter what age you were if you were capable of doing this thing and we wanted to do all this this was something because we were always together we took our lunches with us three stick molds and three stick mitas and we had it in the afternoon cafe and then again six seven o'clock we had our arm pulled so we were all looking forward to things and it was and what's what's nice it's just we don't have all those problems what my own children have today you know i tell them those little things this is just unbelievable and we were happy with that we loved it wonderful family and you slept under the stars in the summertime under the stars sometimes we go to bed with me let's say me me first my dad's sometimes left early and that was if we got up woke up in the morning was a light blanket of snow light snow out there it's only left for there so because it was already late in the season but it happened put us a few times that we got up there quit to sleep at the stars and woke up with a little white snow there on the thing and life had to go on and we just put the heavier jackets on and did i think whatever we had to do how far would you travel in a given summer we draw from you know germany are you bob you everyone knows germany i'm pretty sure from currency to currency was it about six hours one way six hours although those days with the wagons we're probably travel about 20 30 kilometers sometimes not always that's all that's a long thing but horses and wagon to travel but my dad used to especially in the summer when it was too warm for the horses then we left early early in the morning or later at night and we had the little stall lump and they called it hanging on that for lights you know what i mean there was no street lights on those sites streets like that but sometimes we drove late at night or very early in the morning about 4 o'clock and i mean you didn't have to worry about traffic there was no car school and everybody was through the worst of what i can see but the weather condition had a lot to do with the traveling plants too so he kind of knew we were three days or sometimes the weeks on that's two weeks under some of those parking spots we were parked sometimes only three days or two days all depends how the the business was the making a living of course you know and it sounds unbelievable but it's a gorgeous life beautiful happy happy happy life i had to do it all over again i would do it even now my 70 years old i would do it what about the town life as you've seen some of the pictures i showed you this it's a small time that's not that small anymore now but it was where i think they were nine nine hundred or twelve hundred i'd warn us that that particular time is going to be a big city now but everybody knew everybody the schools you know wonderful teachers and everybody admired our lives they always said oh i wish i could and many times it did take some from the neighbors with us for the summer they know mrs. mitt or mrs. johnson who ever was kids of my mother and say oh yeah well she only wants to go with just some you got enough of your own but always one of them came along my mother had fed 14 she fed 15 or 18 many times the neighbors said mrs. baker how can you got his whole stuff for yourself you know you cook for 12 or 15 you cook for 18 so we always had somebody eating there and i'm the same way you come in my house today there's always enough food for a couple extra people did they ever take one of your best friends with you always school friends well we still i have two my girlfriends we just had a 50th golden for confirmation they go for the 50 years the golden confirmation and we graduated from school and there's three of them still we used a house rosarana and those three girls is those two and myself we're still around what are the names emma is one on the alley is the other one last names emma colvin and emma ellie craver wonderful that we were real little actually troublemakers little climb trees worse than the boys and then you know the boys he's only fighting with us want to make this and that but we always start to get it the three of us so and we grew up and the confirmation together and the church together in the time we had some in the winter time and we're home so i think we were about if you really count the months when we were out for me till the first frost is always in the beginning of october we were home and then from october on tell me again was the school steady schooling okay and then the summer first but we did okay so school was year-round in germany all year round oh yeah they get the right if it's fine not in christmas they get off a few we got think a few days and there's a some kind of a summer vacation also and then of course we didn't have to go to school that that was we looked forward to that too and we didn't have to go on the go be war you know and we were out there somewhere but we were looking for that too two or three weeks i think we had off you know this is for the school but tell me i'm curious how do 15 children fit in one wagon yeah i want you to know something we had that wagon like i showed you one of the pictures one of the very good we remember that wagon was six to seven feet long it's almost like a circus wagon if you really look at it but it wasn't this was especially my dad had a wagon made every year every year new wagon because it being a handler the business handled the way he was on the end of the season right in august end of august they called it arnold's and they had a big like a fear there and all the gypsies all the handle hundreds men i came there with their animals with the this and the cows and the horses and the sheep and that's where all the business was done and where is this it was with our old son that is out of town it's a town on our old son yeah and it's very known for that like pomona here for the fair this our olds and was known for this to those hundreds men are with the though they at the animal kingdom and of course they had them rights and this and that music and be it whatever they had there you know i mean but this was every year and then my dad pulled up they were all waiting already the hundreds men are mostly the dark they said black gypsy nessalite gypsy does two different types and always waited for my dad because they knew he was coming in with a new wagon and there was hundreds there's hundreds money made my mother always hated that they go to that occasion there because she had to stop back and took a dip to got an old wagon and my dad sold out the bag of the new wagon or maybe a couple of horses with it or anyway made always business there and my dad used to have him custom made custom make like i said there was seven seven meter six meters seven meter and i think they're four meter wide now i remember the other but just before we went into the camp i remember we had last few years he had him they were all made out of wood carving fancy carving and on the edge he had like lions carved and four on each edge the wagon the lions carved and the windows he had etched glass on them like a trumpeter from seeking some famous person with the inside was not real beautiful too they had double bits in the bag now when the bigger children the boys when they got bigger we had a little unhanger we called it a little docket a little trailer with a tent type over was also custom made it was only for sleeping and there was also made doubled for the girls on the big girls on top separately there was a floor between and the boys on the bottom it's all custom made so then when we are that older and we were traveling like that my mom in the front there like you could see there the we're set in the back there between it's like a connection there was connection there with between the wagon and that trailer there little trailer there was not that little and we used to sit there and used to sing all the way harmony from the first to the second before booth for sisters about the same age there we used to sing good harmony together that my dad used to see sometimes commanded if you get the better with his friends and i want you listen to my daughter's you know we were sitting there and we had to sink there harmonize one german song after another you know i mean and this is those little excitement what i told you about growing up with those type of wonderful wonderful things wonderful wonderful things and you only have those lifetimes ones and you don't never get that chance again you that's why i said you should enjoy all your growth are you growing up at all my children them goes by so fast what language did you speak in your family we speak german of course but we also speak if you with in with the other people they speak that's like a wrongness language okay and that was big then we spoke that with the old folks didn't speak english a german they spoke with the dead wrongness so we're kind of like you know if you're if you're the italian distender and your mother speaks the italian and you speak english of course you don't ever speak it with the mother but you do know the language somehow you learned it from your parent and then somebody comes to you and you do not speak because they don't speak english so you have to kind of use so that's how we learned the little there but i mean between us was the german and of course if i wanted to talk about something like if you girls want to talk about somebody we've talked the wrongness i do it today with my children my children not yeah so today when we are somewhere you can't even speak german because a lot of people speak german here so i used the wrongness language my kids don't but they do even my friends and their 24 he's doing real good with it most of your friends other gypsies who were they ethnic germans no we had some of the girls who we met out there in the trip sister of course we had some there and that's it was short times that the important the long lasting long lasting french was always anyway but with steadiness is when we work at home to be in the cup and then of course there were six months were we're or there and went to this school we went to the place we went to just going for work sunday mornings we take a couple of kids along and we worked up in the hill i know we had a dog we had a dog whose name was child over my dad was my oldest brother's dog he my dad had bought it for him and that dog was 17 years old and he got blind i have so of course the dog grew up but as we all most of us grew up with that dog some of them weren't even born yet but halfway through like my myself we were raised with that dog so he was 17 years old he was blind and had to be put away but that's it you cannot do that anymore so of course you could imagine what was going on my oldest brother heinrich got sick over it he was 17 and of course we all but he hired a forest and he shot him and then we buried him out up on the hill on the wood on the pine tree and this was got to be known to all the children there was beggars dog, child were buried there everybody brought little flowers and and the little crosses and that tree was all carved with different names and it's been there for years for years we grew up with that that hill up there and it was quite a war and my mother and sunday mornings was after church we had to go to church and it was because she was cooking early church we had to go they were cooking my mother my dad my dad loved to cook sunday was she help her and she says like julia yeah never mind i'm a kind i swear i take the little ones there one or two or three and take a nice little work bring job with some flowers up there just to get rid of us for a while, take a little big kids for a while and that's that's the way it was you know and all the friends too oh well let's take a walk up to church you something to do and on the way up there we talked the way you know i mean nice tell me you went to church on sundays yeah how we what we raised we i was my mom mom was a catholic my father was protestant and somehow they decided they raised us as a protestant lutheran so my mother never went to the lutheran church my mother kept her religion she didn't go to catholic church either but she had her little statues did her little beliefs but she did not go to church with us my dad every sunday that's one thing he did he took us to church and boy if we weren't there that was one thing he worked up there with his little slew there one after the other we had all put some shoes and the this and that anyway we did go to church and then as go on the school you have to go to catechism we did that and of course when you're 13 14 you go to confirmation you finish when you're at school and then you have to go into some household things from ever just before i went we got arrested i had just started my household year i was about 50 and i started as little as he kept me for the he had a job the war was already started at that time and he was working for the the city there pulling wood with the wagon cutting

something just yeah just the girls just the girls and of course boys automatically went into learn like an ailing they went into you know girls didn't go into much for the the learning a train at that time there was house getting the housewife and learning how to cook and how to clean you know i mean that's that's the situation so house was very important i know my sister in this one particular

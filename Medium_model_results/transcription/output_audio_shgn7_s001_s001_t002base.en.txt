I had a lot of fun playing soccer and having a lot of fun with my friends on the street of Mars. And it was a great time. We had a lot of fun. Didn't do much other stuff as growing up as a kid. Pretty much just all I did was play soccer and just hanging out with my friend. And yeah, I really miss it. Describe your childhood. My childhood was good. I had loving parents. I had sick siblings. So we had a lot of fun together. My grandparents also... I spent a lot of time with my grandparents. So that was fun. The really looked after me. Life on Mars is pretty good. There's a lot of stuff to do as a kid. It was a good time. What was life like for you as a child? Well, as I said, I just played soccer most of the time. On Mars, I didn't do much other than that. I walked around and looked at the different space stations that were on Mars. Those really fascinated me. As a child, I guess the main thing that was playing soccer and just looked around. And we checked out those space stations. I also spent a lot of time just staring into the universe. That was great. What was your daily routine as a child? Daily routine as a child. I would wake up probably around QAM, Mars Standard Time. Have breakfast and then just head out to school. Spend a couple hours there and come back for lunch. Come back home for lunch. In the afternoon, I would just go out, had soccer practice. After dad just went home, had dinner, and just relaxed for the rest of the night. Shera, happy your favorite memory from your childhood? Happy your favorite memory. The best memory was probably when I fell off a cliff and still managed to survive. That was really fun. That wasn't really fun. It was my favorite memory because the thrill of falling down a cliff was really fun. I think just dad, really just sticking my memory. That's really a very memorable part of my childhood. What kind of a child were you? I was smart, disciplined, and also just messed around a little bit. I liked doing a little pranks here and there. Was in your family? My family was my parents, my siblings, my grandparents, and also our family dog with the name of Mark. What was your family like before you became a professional soccer player? It was a loving family. I spent a lot of time with my siblings. There's nothing that special about it, and I don't think becoming a professional soccer player changed any of that. We're still the family that we are, that we used to be. What were your parents' names? My parents' names, my dad's name is Michael. My mom's name is Ashley. Describe your parents. My dad is a very serious man, doesn't talk much, but he gets things done and I have a lot of respect for him. My mom, she's a lovely woman. She looks after me and my siblings. That creates a lot of her time to the family. What did your father or family do for a living before you became a professional soccer player? My father was a basketball player and my mom was a film producer. What was your father like? My father was a serious man. Amazing at basketball. He can't really dunk on me. Even though now he's like 60, he can probably still be a one-on-one in basketball. But anyway, he's a serious man and doesn't really like to joke around a lot. What was your mother like? My mom is very caring. It really takes care of me. She loves taking care of everyone who's around her. What do you remember about your extended family? My extended family. Honestly, I don't remember much about them. Obviously, growing up on Mars, my extended family, they were still back on the Earth, so I didn't really have a lot of contact with them.

Fred, there was Ken and Omar, my sisters, Maria, Alice, and my youngest sister. Her name is Bella. What was your relationship like with your siblings? Pretty good. Had a lot of fun together. Had a lot of fights with my brothers, but that's how many siblings are. We look after each other. Describe your family home. My family home. Just a standard house on Mars. Not much in there, except for the basic necessities. Living on Mars is tough. You don't get a lot of stuff that you get on Earth. We don't have many families. We don't have a backyard. We do have an area in the house to plan a little bit of vegetables here and there. I spent a lot of time there. Other than that, life on Mars is hard. It's just a standard house that you will see in any space stations. What languages did you speak as a child at home? I spoke the language on Mars, obviously. I spoke English, Swahili, and Afrikan, and Mandarin Chinese. What was your family's religious identity before you were a professional soccer player? We are atheists, so no religious identity. What did your religion mean to you as a child? As I said, I made the ASO. Not really much meaning in terms of that. Do you have a favorite festival or holiday when you were growing up? Sure. I really love the Independence Day of Mars. We do a lot of crazy stuff on that day. My dad used to just take a spaceship and we will just go out of the solar system and go for a tour around the universe and come back to Mars. That was pretty much my favorite festival when I was a kid. How did your family practice their faith before you became a professional soccer player? Not much. They were atheists, so they don't really practice anything. What were your friends like before you became a professional soccer player? My friends were, you know, they're...how can I say? We did a lot of crazy stuff. We had a really good relationship with them. Basically, we grew up playing soccer together on the street on Mars. Other than that, we also did a lot of crazy stuff that we probably shouldn't have done. You know, it was just a very wild group of boys. What happened to your friends from before you were a professional soccer player? From before, I am still in contact with most of them. Two of them sadly passed away on the mission to Jupiter. Yeah, so...yeah, we all missed them. But for the rest of the boys, we still have a pretty good relationship. You know, we still hang out sometime, just have a good time together. What was school like when you were younger? School was...school was...how can I say? It was fun, but it was also just like any other school. So it's strict at school. You know, we had a really strict home room teacher and also head of grade. So, didn't really got to do much crazy stuff at school. But yeah, school was a good memory. I mean, I definitely learned a lot. Did you do well in school? I did okay. I got A's and B's. What were your favorite things to do as a child? Probably just play soccer and nap. I really liked taking naps, you know, throughout the day. What were your favorite sports or games to play when you were young? I played soccer, but I also played baseball and parasailing.

Were you ever bullied as a child? Not really. I mean, I feel like I was always the bully instead of getting bullied. Yeah. How old were you when you became a professional soccer player? Oh, I got my first contract with Shanghai Shanghai Shanghai when I was 16 years old. How long were you with that team? I mean, I played for their academy system for three years. So, including Academy time and also my time there, I think in total, like probably ten years. Yeah, that would be accurate. How long were you at your next team? I was at my next team for three seasons. We can go through all these two. So, should I just say once that he sends it? Yeah, twice. So, we're going to do, like, Jackman's going to say something about you're going to repeat it. Yeah. And then give it like a three to five second count and then repeat it again. Okay.

What was it like to return home after your soccer career ended? Oh, it was definitely... Definitely spell special. Having played for such a long time, pretty much, you know, all throughout my life, going home after a tire, and this... You feel... There's a lot of emptiness inside, not knowing what to do and just waking up in the middle of the night and just not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow. I definitely wouldn't say it's great. It was a great feeling to finally come home after playing. You know. Yeah. After your career ended, how did you start over with nothing? I took up a job as an electrical engineer on Mars and the space stations. I just started off from scratch learning from the basics, just trying to flip my life up with something meaningful. So, yeah. How did you rebuild your life? I first started off as an electrical engineer, electrician. And then I joined the mob on the Mars. It was... I didn't have much other choice. I mean, I was looking for something thrilling in life, so I just joined the mob. And, you know, started off as, you know, just a nobody in the mob and just worked my way up from, you know, finishing up the task that my boss told me to do. And just doing what I've been told and staying humble, just worked my way up. Were you able to ever recover any of your possessions from your childhood? I had a little bit of a here and there, not much though. Is there any item that you missed from when you were growing up? Yes. It was a mug that my friend gave me on my 18th birthday. It meant a lot for me, but I lost there somewhere. So, you know, just... I was looking forward to it, but never able to find it again. How was seeing your family after the end of your career? It was emotional. Obviously, they were on Mars, so they can't, you know, go watch me play. But returning to my family was definitely emotional and, yeah, we had a good time together. Who took care of you after your career ended? Myself. What do you remember from right when your career ended? I just remember playing my last game and waving goodbye to the fans in the stadium. It was definitely emotional and there was a lot of tears. Yeah. And, you know, right after Dad, it was really just like empty. You know, there was nothing going on in life. I didn't go to practice. You know, obviously, he didn't play and he didn't play recreationally. You know, I just said goodbye to soccer. When did you come to Earth? I came to Earth when I was 13 years old when I joined the Academy. Yeah. Why did you come to Earth? To play soccer. Obviously, on Mars, the opportunities aren't there. You know, there aren't any teams. Earth was the closest thing to fulfilling my dream of becoming a professional player. What was your experience like coming to Earth from Mars? It was a long journey. It was probably like three weeks or so just on a spaceship. A lot of turbulence here and there. We also got attacked by a bunch of aliens. But with me, you know, it was fun. We had a nice conversation with them, so they decided to not take any possession from us. The journey itself was, yeah, it was a story. What language barriers did you have on Earth? And how did you overcome them? Non, I spoke a lot of languages. I always found myself to be a smart with languages. I can pick new language from scratch, you know, it just mattered a few days. So not a real language barrier, but not really a language barrier. And I also think sports is a universal language. You know, everybody loves sports. So, yeah. How did you learn these different languages? I learned by using apps on my phone and also by talking to local people. Yeah. What expectations did you have about Earth? Oh, I expected it to be a beautiful place, which it is. I expected a lot of stress, a lot of stress that doesn't need to be there. You know, obviously we didn't have any stress back on Mars. You know, everyone was living a good life. But, you know, Earth is fine. I think in terms of stress, definitely it wasn't that much. But yeah, I definitely had that expectation coming in when I was a kid. Did you go through an orientation before or after you settled on Earth? Yeah. Obviously, I joined the Academy team for soccer. So my coach gave me a little run through of what life was like on Earth. You know, just how to deal with different things, how to use Apple Pay, you know, how to use, how to check emails. I don't know what an email was, how to use the internet, everything. Yeah. Was the host community on Earth welcoming? Yeah, really welcoming. You know, just really took me under their winds. Yeah, I appreciate the help. What surprised you the most about living on Earth? Mainly just the amount of oxygen that's on Earth. Yeah, crazy, I mean, there's so much oxygen to breathe in. You know, I took me a while to get used to that. And also just talking to people, you know, saying, you know, hi, how are you doing? You know, I was already used to that when I was back on Mars. But yeah, definitely took a while for me to get used to that. Share a happy year favorite memory about living on Earth? With a lot of memories, too many memories for me to recount, to be honest. I would say that my favorite memory would be my first game that played as a professional player, which is a dream come true moment. Yeah. Did you experience difficulties adapting to Earth? A lot. As I said, adapting to how people interact with each other here, you know, just adapting to really how things work, you know, using different tools, using my phone. You know, phone was a really, it was a pain, you know. It took me a while to get used to, you know, pressing all these buttons on my phone, you know, getting used to how all the apps work. It took me a while. What disappointments did you have about Earth? Oh, a lot. Climate. People. A lot of things. You know, there's a lot going on Earth every day. Politics. You know, I just feel like, you know, we don't have to live life. That's like that. But, you know, it's happening. So, yeah, disappointing that in that matter. Where do you live now? I live in Mars. I bought myself a nice house. Yeah. In Marsville, it's a neighborhood that's called. Really nice place. I have a fantastic view of the landscape on Mars. Yeah. Did you continue your education after your soccer career ended? No, I hate a school, so no. Did you like school? I didn't like school. What was your career? My career was just playing soccer. They paid me money to do that. And I play for people who would pay money to come watch me and my team has played. Did you like your career? Yeah, 100%. I liked every single day except for the injuries. The injuries were painful and disappointing. But other than that, I love my career. What is your happiest memory after your soccer career ended? I was probably when I first, you know, got inducted into the mob, you know. I was happy because I finally found a community to take me under their winds and, you know, that was really happy. Are you married? No. Let's pause here.

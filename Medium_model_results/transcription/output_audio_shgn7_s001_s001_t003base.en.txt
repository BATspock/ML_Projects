 Hang on one second, let me just start with your voice recording on my phone and then I'm going to slide it again and then you can go for it. Alright, I'm going to try to remove it like this. Okay. Can you introduce yourself? Sure. Um, hi. I'm Jaclyn Marion and I'm a professional chef. When and where were you born? I was born in London in 2002. What was your name on birth? My name was Jaclyn Marion, Amber. And how do you spell that name? Um, my first name is spelled J-A-C-L-Y-N, so a little bit differently than most Jaclyn's. I described life in your hometown before you became a professional chef. Life was great. I am an only child, but I always knew that I loved cooking mostly because I love trying new foods, so I loved eating different things, so it inspired me to cook them. Describe your childhood. My childhood was very eventful. I tried all sorts of different hobbies. I tried all sorts of different sports. Everything that you might expect a kid to try, but most kids were not into cooking like me, but I decided that I enjoyed it. What was your daily routine if there was one as a child? As a child, I mostly went to school every day, so I would get up and get ready for school. I would go to school. When I'd come home, that would be my free time, so I would play outside or I would play around with some cooking. On the weekends, that was when I really liked to cook and be with my family. Sure, are you happy with your favorite memory from your childhood? My favorite memory from my childhood was when I first baked chocolate chip cookies well, because I tried so many times and I wasn't very good when I first started, but I remember when I finally made the best batch of chocolate chip cookies, I was so proud of myself, and I was really young too, so it's nice to see how far I've come from that moment. What kind of a child were you? I was an intellectual and very humble also. I loved school, I loved reading, I just loved filling my time with all sorts of interesting things. Who was your family? I just had my two parents, and then I was an only child. What were your parents' names? My mom was Julie and my dad was Jason. Would you describe your parents? Yes, I had great parents, they were very overprotective parents, but they were also very supportive of my dreams to cook, and I was inspired by them. What did your father or family do for a living before you became a chef? Both of them were also chefs, so I learned from the best and they were the ones who first taught me when I was younger. What do you remember about your extended family? Both my parents were also only children, so I had no siblings, no cousins. It was just me and the food, so I had a very deep relationship with the food. Well, languages did you speak as a child at home? English, that is all. I didn't know different languages. What was your family's religious identity before you became a chef? We didn't have a specific religion, so I guess we could say we were atheist, but we were so devoted to our hobby of cooking. It was like a religion to us in its own sense. So how did your family practice this faith before you became a chef? Cooking food is amazing. I also loved going to the grocery store and seeing all the potential there for different dishes. It was very special. What were your friends like? I didn't have many friends, mostly because I think I was advanced for my age. I think I was thinking about bigger things and wanting to do bigger things with my life than the other kids around me, so I was kind of a lone wolf. So what was school like before you became a chef? Well, as I mentioned before, I'm incredibly smart. So school was a breeze for me, but I did really enjoy reading and going to school. Did you do well at school? Yes. What were your favorite sports or games to play when you were young? I'm not really much of an athlete, not very into sports, and I wasn't then, so as you can tell, I'm very focused on one thing. So I tried, I dabbled in some other sports and hobbies, but none of them were ever for me. What music did you like when you were young? Classical. I really like Beethoven. Did you have any pets? Were you a child? No, I did not. Were you ever bullied or was it a child before? Yes, but I didn't let it bother me. It was just everyone wished that they could be me, so that was probably the root of the issue, but that didn't bother me. You can skip that section. Let's keep it all. Yeah. You can talk about culinary school if you want to use that section. Describe the moment you arrived at the culinary school. It was a great moment. I immediately knew that I belonged there, and it just, it was how I knew that I was in the right place, and my career was headed in that direction, so I was very excited. Was there a daily routine, and what was that like in school? Yes, well, every day I would go to different classes. I would learn different cooking techniques, how to make different dishes, pretty much some basic ones that everyone who goes to culinary school learns, but I obviously did it better. And then there would also be time for me to explore and cook on my own. What was the food like? The food was obviously fantastic. I learned how to make so many new interesting things and came up with some recipes on my own, so that's the one thing about being around amazing chefs is you're always eating well. How did you leave the school, and where did you go after that? I graduated early because I was the best one there, and immediately after I had offers from a number of restaurants, Michelin Star restaurants, they wanted me to come cook for them, but I said, you know what, I'm on top, I'm not going to help other people with me. I already have this success, I'm just going to keep building on it, so I opened my own restaurant. What was life like in the restaurant? Life in the restaurant was very chaotic initially because we were trying to get everything set up. Immediately we got a lot of attention, people did know my name, so we had a lot of people coming, but it just, in the initial stages, it was very chaotic to get things up and running. What were the work conditions in the restaurant? Very glamorous, I would say. State of the art everything, we spared no expense on this restaurant, so I made sure everything was the best. What was the name of the restaurant? The name of the restaurant was...computer. The name of the restaurant was computer. How did you come over that name? The way that I came up with this name was that computers were something that always fascinated me. I feel like they're so innovative and cutting edge, and that was what I wanted to achieve through my food. It's not a name that you would expect from a restaurant, and I like that. I like doing things that people aren't going to expect. What was it like to return home after he or chef's career? I never went home, is the thing. I had achieved all these great things, and I didn't want to leave it for a second. I just wanted to stay around and see how the restaurant that I started kept flourishing. Did you rebuild your life and how did you start over? Well, then I had more time for just personal cooking. I say, one never stops learning, especially in the kitchen. Although I had my restaurant run my own restaurant, I still was trying new things, perfecting things that I had done in the past. My life's goal and center still remained pretty much the same. Who took care of you after your retirement? Myself. And did you go to another country or...? No, I stayed where I was. I couldn't bear to leave the sight of my success. What disappointments did you have about your sight of success, if any? Very little. Very little. I was surrounded by people who knew my name, people would come up to me on the street. I love that. I love the attention. So, yeah, I positioned myself perfectly to get that attention. What challenges did you face over the years as a previously known chef? I would say besides the initial beginning of the restaurant where things were a little bit crazy, I had very few challenges. I, as we've established, am an amazing chef, very competent. I know my stuff. I don't run into many issues. How were you affected by your experience as a chef in life? I think it brought my life purpose and meaning. It was something I had discovered that I enjoyed since I was young. So, to be able to pursue that for the rest of my life is something that I am thankful for because I know not everyone has that opportunity. What kind of food do you specialize in? Primarily dishes with zucchini. There's so much you can do with zucchini. I feel like it personally is really underrated. So, I love working with zucchini. I work across different cuisines with this, my favorite vegetable. How would your career have been if cuisines never existed? If zucchini never existed, I honestly don't know what I do. I mean, maybe squash. Maybe I'd work with squash instead in the gourd family. What is the most difficult part of cooking? For me, the most difficult part of cooking is the fact that you can put hours and hours into a dish, but then everyone loves it so much and it's so delicious that it's gone in a couple of minutes. I guess that is a good thing because it means that what I've made is just so perfect and amazing, but it's all consumed in a matter of seconds. How do your customers describe you as a chef? I think my customers come to my restaurant because they've heard about me. They want to experience what they've heard. I think they're in awe of me, which as they should be rightfully so. I would say that I think people come to my restaurant, a computer for an experience. This isn't just a regular Tuesday night. This is your anniversary, your birthday. This is your wedding. This is a huge deal. That's what people get when they come to my restaurant. Throughout the years, have you had any customer that you particularly remember? I would say the Queen of England was she was a close friend. She would come to a restaurant often. That was probably my favorite person to cook for. What was the Queen's favorite dish? She liked very much fried zucchini. That was her favorite. One of my personal favorites as well. Is the Queen's family also a customer of your restaurant? Yes, but I don't like them as much as I like the Queen. I want to talk about computer again. That's the vibe I get. What is the vibe like in computer? Computer, as I've mentioned before, is an experience. You come into the restaurant and you are greeted by decor like you've never seen. It's very futuristic, yet also timeless. It's impossible to describe. You have to see it for yourself, but computer is just nothing like it. Anywhere else?

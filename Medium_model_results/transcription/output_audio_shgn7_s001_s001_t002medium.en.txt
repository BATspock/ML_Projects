I definitely wouldn't say it was a great feeling to finally come home after playing. After your career ended, how did you start over with nothing? I took up a job as an electrical engineer on Mars and the space stations. I just started off from scratch learning from the basics, just trying to fill my life up with something meaningful.

I came to Earth when I was 13 years old, when I joined the Academy. Why did you come to Earth? To play soccer. On Mars, the opportunities aren't there. There aren't any teams. Earth was the closest thing to fulfilling my dream of becoming a professional player. What was your experience like coming to Earth from Mars? It was a long journey. It was probably three weeks or so on a spaceship. A lot of turbulence here and there. We also got attacked by a bunch of aliens. With me, it was fun. We had a nice conversation with them, so they decided to not take any possession from us. The journey itself was a story. What language barriers did you have on Earth and how did you overcome them? None. I spoke a lot of languages. I always found myself to be smart with languages. I can pick new languages from scratch in a matter of a few days. Not really a language barrier. I also think sports is a universal language. Everybody loves sports. How did you learn these different languages? I learned by using apps on my phone and also by talking to local people. What expectations did you have about Earth? I expected it to be a beautiful place, which it is. I expected a lot of stress. A lot of stress that doesn't need to be there. Obviously, we didn't have any stress back on Mars. Everyone was living a good life. Earth is fine. In terms of stress, it definitely wasn't that much. I definitely had that expectation coming in when I was a kid. Did you go through an orientation before or after you settled on Earth? Yeah. Obviously, I joined the Academy team for soccer.

How to use the internet. Everything. Was the host community on Earth welcoming? Yeah, really welcoming. It just really took me under the winds. I appreciate the help. What surprised you the most about living on Earth? Mainly just the amount of oxygen that's on Earth. Crazy. There's so much oxygen to breathe in. It took me a while to get used to that. And also just talking to people. Saying, hi, how are you doing? I wasn't really used to that when I was back on Mars. But, yeah. It definitely took a while for me to get used to that. Share a happier favorite memory about living on Earth? A lot of memories. Too many memories for me to recount, to be honest. I would say my favorite memory would be my first game that I played as a professional player. It was a dream come true moment. Did you experience difficulties adapting to Earth? A lot. As I said, adapting to how people interact with each other here. Just adapting to really how things work. Using different tools. Using my phone. Phone was a pain.

People. A lot of things. There's a lot going on on Earth. Everyday. Politics. I just feel like we don't have to live a life that's like that. But it's happening. So, yeah.

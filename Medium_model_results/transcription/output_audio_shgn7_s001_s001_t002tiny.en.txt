What was life like for you as a child? Well, as I said, I just played soccer most of the time and, you know, on Mars, you know, I didn't do much other than that. I mean, I walked around and, you know, looked at the different space stations. There were on Mars, you know, those really fascinated me. And, you know, as a child, I just, I guess the main thing that there was, was the place of soccer and, you know, just looked around and, you know, would check, check out those space stations. And also, I also spent a lot of time just staring into the universe. That was great. What was your daily routine as a child? Daily routine as a child. I would wake up probably around 2am, Mars standard time, have breakfast and then just head out to, head out to school, you know, spend a couple hours there and come back for lunch, come back home for lunch and, yeah, and just in the afternoon, I would just go out and had soccer practice and, you know, just after that, I just, you know, went home, had dinner and just relaxed for the rest of the night. Sure a happy or a favorite memory from your childhood. A happy or favorite memory. I mean, the best memory was probably when I fell off a cliff and still, you know, managed to survive.

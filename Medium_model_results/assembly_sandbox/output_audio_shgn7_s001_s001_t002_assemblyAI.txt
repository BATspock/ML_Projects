Well, as I said, I just play soccer most of the time, and on Mars I didn't do much other than that.
I mean, I walked around and looked at the different space stations that were on Mars. Those really fascinated me. And as a child, I guess the main thing that I did was play socket. I just looked around and checked out those space stations, and I also spent a lot of time just staring into the universe. That was great.

School was how can I say it was fun, but it was also just like any other school. It's strict at school.

What was it like to return home after your soccer career ended? It was definitely spelled special.
Having played for such a long time, pretty much all throughout my life, going home after retiring, there's a lot of emptiness inside. Not knowing what to do and just waking up in the middle of the night and not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow, I definitely wouldn't say it's great to it was a great feeling to finally come home after playing.
After your career ended, how did you start over with nothing? I took up a job as an electrical engineer on Mars and the space stations. I just started off from scratch, learning from the basics, just trying to flood my life up with something meaningful. How did you rebuild your life? I first started off as an electrical engineer, electrician, and then I joined the mob on the mars.
Didn't have much other choice. I mean, I was looking for something thrilling in life, so I just joined a mob and started off as a nobody in the mob and just worked my way up from finishing up the task that my boss told me to do and just doing what I've been told and staying humble, just work my way up. Were you able to ever recover any of your possessions from your childhood? A little bit here and there. Not much though.
Is there any item that you missed from when you were growing up? Yes, it was a mug that my friend gave me on my birthday. Meant a lot for me, but I lost it somewhere, so I always been looking for it but never able to find it again. How was seeing your family after the end of your career? It was emotional, obviously they were on Mars, so they can't go watch me play, but returning to my family was definitely emotional and, yeah, we had a good time together.
Who took care of you after your career ended? Myself.
What do you remember from right when your career ended? I just remember playing my last game and waving goodbye to the fans in the stadium. It was definitely emotional and there's a lot of tears right after dad. It was really just like, empty. There was nothing going on.
Life. I didn't go to practice, obviously didn't play any didn't play recreationally. I just said goodbye to soccer. When did you come to Earth? I came to Earth when I was 13 years old, when I joined the academy.
Why did you come to Earth? To play soccer? Obviously on Mars the opportunities aren't there. There aren't any teams. Earth was the closest thing to fulfilling my dream of becoming a professional player.
What was your experience like coming to Earth from Mars? It was a long journey. It was probably like three weeks or so, just on a spaceship. A lot of turbulence here and there. We also got attacked by a bunch of aliens, but it was fun.
We had a nice conversation with them, so they decided to not take any possession from us. The journey itself was a story. What language barriers did you have on Earth and how did you overcome them? None. I spoke a lot of languages.
I always found myself to be smart with languages. I can pick new language from scratch in just a matter of few days. So not really a language barrier, but not really a language barrier. And I also think sports is a universal language. Everybody loves sports.
How did you learn these different languages? I learned by using apps on my phone and also by talking to local people. What expectations did you have about Earth? I expect it to be a beautiful place, which it is.
I expected a lot of stress. A lot of stress that doesn't need to be there. Obviously we didn't have any stress back on mars. Everyone was living a good life, but Earth is fine. I think in terms of stress, definitely wasn't that much, but I definitely had that expectation coming in when I was a kid.
Did you go through an orientation before or after you settled on Earth? Yeah, obviously. I joined the academy team for soccer, so my coach gave me a little run through of what life was like on Earth. Just how to deal with different things, how to use Apple Pay, how to check emails. I don't know what email was, how to use the internet.
Everything was the host community on Earth. Welcoming? Yeah, really welcoming. Just really took me under their wins. I appreciate the help.
What surprised you the most about living on Earth? Mainly just the amount of oxygen that's on Earth. It's crazy. I mean, there's so much oxygen to breathe in. It took me a while to get used to that.
And also just talking to people, saying, hi, how are you doing? I was already used to that when I was back on March, but yeah, it definitely took a while for me to do that. Share a happy or favorite memory about living on her with a lot of memories. Too many memories for me to recount, to be honest. I would say my favorite memory will be my first game that I play as a professional player, which is a dream come true moment.
Did you experience difficulties adapting to Earth a lot? As I said, adapting to how people interact with each other here. Just adapting to really how things work. Using different tools, using my phone, it was a pain. It took me a while to get used to pressing all these buttons on my phone.
Getting used to how all the apps work took me a while. What disappointments did you have about Earth? Oh, a lot. Climate, people, a lot of things. There's a lot going on Earth every day, politics.
I just feel like we don't have to live a life that's like that, but it's happening, so yeah, disappointing in that matter. Where do you live now? I live in Mars. I bought myself a nice house in Marsville. It's a neighborhood that's called really nice place.
Have a fantastic view of the landscape on Mars. Yeah. Did you continue your education after your soccer career ended? No, I hate a school. Did you like school?
I didn't like school. What was your career? My career was just playing soccer. I kick soccer balls for clubs. They pay me money to do that, and I play for people who would pay money to come watch me and my team is played.
Did you like your career? Yeah, 100%. Liked every single day of it, except for the injuries. Injuries were painful and disappointing, but other than that, I loved my career. What is your happiest memory after your soccer career ended?
That was probably when I first got inducted into the Mob I was happy because I finally found a community to a community to take. The editor wins. And that was rehabbing. Are you married? No.

SPEAKER_00,0.0:23.0:29.0:375.0,0.0:23.0:41.0:863.0, to place soccer. Obviously, on Mars it's the opportunities aren't there. There aren't any teams. Earth was the closest thing to fulfill in my dream of becoming a professional player.
SPEAKER_01,0.0:23.0:43.0:10.0,0.0:23.0:46.0:739.0, What was your experience like coming to Earth from Mars?
SPEAKER_00,0.0:23.0:46.0:638.0,0.0:23.0:58.0:112.99999999976717, I was a law journey. I was probably like three weeks or so just on a spaceship. A lot of turbulence here and there. I also got attacked by a bunch of aliens.
SPEAKER_00,0.0:23.0:58.0:703.0,0.0:24.0:5.0:554.0, But with me, it was fun. We had a nice conversation with them, so they decided to not take any possession from us.
SPEAKER_00,0.0:24.0:6.0:280.0,0.0:24.0:6.0:769.0, gods.
SPEAKER_00,0.0:24.0:7.0:411.0,0.0:24.0:11.0:545.0, The journey itself was, yeah, it was a story.
SPEAKER_01,0.0:24.0:12.0:878.0,0.0:24.0:17.0:197.99999999976717, What language barriers did you have on earth and how did you overcome them? AH GOD
SPEAKER_00,0.0:24.0:16.0:658.0,0.0:24.0:36.0:166.0, Oh, non-high-spoken law languages. I always found myself to be a smart with languages. I can pick new language from scratch, you know, and just matter a few days. So not a real language barrier, not a really a language barrier. And also, think sports is a universal language. You know, everybody loves sports. So, yeah.
SPEAKER_01,0.0:24.0:36.0:824.0,0.0:24.0:39.0:423.0, how did you learn these different languages?
SPEAKER_00,0.0:24.0:39.0:372.0,0.0:24.0:45.0:278.0, I learned by using apps on my phone and also by talking to local people.
SPEAKER_01,0.0:24.0:46.0:477.0,0.0:24.0:48.0:991.0, What expectations did you have without Earth?
SPEAKER_00,0.0:24.0:49.0:244.0,0.0:24.0:53.0:598.0, I expect it to be a beautiful place, which it is.
SPEAKER_00,0.0:24.0:54.0:897.0,0.0:25.0:17.0:493.0, I expect a lot of stress, a lot of stress that doesn't need to be there. You know, obviously we didn't have any stress back on Mars and everyone was living again, living a good life. But you know, Earth is fine. I think in terms of stress, definitely it wasn't that much, but yeah, I definitely had that expectation coming in when I was a kid.
SPEAKER_01,0.0:25.0:18.0:337.0,0.0:25.0:23.0:113.0, Did you go through an orientation before or after you settle on earth? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00,0.0:25.0:22.0:522.0,0.0:25.0:45.0:961.0, Yeah, obviously I joined the Academy team for soccer, so my coach gave me a little run through of what life was like on earth. You know, just how to deal with different things, how to use Apple Pay, you know, how to use, how to check emails. I don't know what email was, how to use the internet, everything. Yeah.

SPEAKER_00,0.0:26.0:2.0:532.0,0.0:26.0:28.0:957.9999999997672, Mainly just the amount of oxygen that's on Earth, crazy. I mean, there's so much oxygen to breathing. You know, I took me a while to use to that. And also just talking to people, you know, saying, you know, hi, how are you doing? You know, I was already used to that, you know, when I was back on Mars, but yeah, definitely took a while for me that I could use to that.

SPEAKER_00,0.0:26.0:58.0:625.0,0.0:27.0:24.0:123.0, adapting to how people interact with each other here, just adapting to really how things work, using different tools, using my phone. Phone was a really, it was a pain. It took me a while to get used to pressing all these buttons on my phone, getting used to how all the apps work took me a while.
